      "It is important that you achieve an optimum test results while conducting software testing without deviating from the goal. But how you determine that you are following right strategy for testing? For that, you need to stick to some basic testing principles. Here are the common seven testing principles that are widely practiced in the software industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are the 7 Principles:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Exhaustive testing is not possible\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes!Exhaustive testing is not possible. Instead, we need the optimal amount of testing based on the risk assessment of the application.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the million dollar question is, how do you determine this risk ?\n",
      "\n",
      "To answer this let's do an exercise\n",
      "\n",
      "In your opinion, Which operation is most likely to cause your Operating system to fail?\n",
      "\n",
      "I am sure most of you would have guessed, Opening 10 different application all at the same time. So if you were testing this Operating system, you would realize that defects are likely to be found in multitasking activity and need to be tested thoroughly which brings us to our next principle Defect Clustering\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Defect Clustering\n",
      "\n",
      "Defect Clustering which states that a small number of modules contain most of the defects detected. This is the application of the Pareto Principle to software testing: approximately 80% of the problems are found in 20% of the modules.\n",
      "By experience, you can identify such risky modules. But this approach has its own problems\n",
      "\n",
      "If the same tests are repeated over and over again , eventually the same test cases will no longer find new bugs.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Pesticide Paradox\n",
      "\n",
      "Repetitive use of the same pesticide mix to eradicate insects during farming will over time lead to the insects developing resistance to the pesticide Thereby ineffective of pesticides on insects. The same applies to software testing. If the same set of repetitive tests are conducted, the method will be useless for discovering new defects.\n",
      "\n",
      "To overcome this, the test cases need to be regularly reviewed & revised , adding new & different test cases to help find more defects.\n",
      "4) Testing shows presence of defects\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, testing principle states that -Testing talks about the presence of defects and don’t talk about the absence of defects. i.e. Software Testing reduces the probability of undiscovered defects remaining in the software but even if no defects are found, it is not a proof of correctness.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what if , you work extra hard , taking all precautions & make your software product 99% bug-free. And the software does not meet the needs & requirements of the clients. This leads us to our next principle, which states that-Absence of Error\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Absence of Error\n",
      "\n",
      "It is possible that software which is 99% bug-free is still unusable. This can be the case if the system is tested thoroughly for the wrong requirement. Software testing is not mere finding defects, but also to check that software addresses the business needs. Absence of Error is a Fallacy i.e. Finding and fixing defects does not help if the system build is unusable and does not fulfill the user's needs & requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "To solve this problem , the next principle of testing states that Early Testing\n",
      "\n",
      "6) Early Testing\n",
      "\n",
      "Early Testing  Testing should start as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle. So that any defects in the requirements or design phase are captured in early stages. It is much cheaper to fix a defect in early stages of testing. But how early one should start testing? It is recommended that you start finding the bug the moment the requirements are defined. \n",
      "\n",
      "7) Testing is context dependent\n",
      "\n",
      "Testing is context dependent which basically means that the way you test an ecommerce site will be different from the way you test a commercial off the shelf application. All the developed software’s are not identical. You might use a different approach, methodologies, techniques and types of testing depending upon the application type. For instance testing, any POS system at a retail store will be different than testing an ATM machine.\n",

The automation software can also enter test data into the System Under Test , compare expected and actual results and generate detailed test reports. Test Automation demands considerable investments of money and resources. Successive development cycles will require execution of same test suite repeatedly. Using a test automation tool it's possible to record this test suite and replay it as required. Once the test suite is automated, no human intervention is required .

      "Since Selenium is a collection of different tools, it had different developers as well. Below are the key persons who made notable contributions to the Selenium Project.\n",
      "Primarily, Selenium was created by Jason Huggins in 2004. An engineer at ThoughtWorks, he was working on a web application that required frequent testing. Having realized that the repetitious manual testing of their application was becoming more and more inefficient, he created a JavaScript program that would automatically control the browser's actions. He named this program as the \"JavaScriptTestRunner.\"\n",
      "Seeing potential in this idea to help automate other web applications, he made Java Script Runner open-source which was later re-named as Selenium Core.\n",

      "\n",
      "Continuous Integration is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository at regular intervals. This concept was meant to remove the problem of finding later occurrence of issues in the build lifecycle. Continuous integration requires the developers to have frequent builds. The common practice is that whenever a code commit occurs, a build should be triggered.\n",

      "\n",
      "JUnit is a unit testing framework for Java programming language. It plays a crucial role test-driven development, and is a family of unit testing frameworks collectively known as xUnit.\n",
      "JUnit promotes the idea of \"first testing then coding\", which emphasizes on setting up the test data for a piece of code that can be tested first and then implemented. This approach is like \"test a little, code a little, test a little, code a little.\" It increases the productivity of the programmer and the stability of program code, which in turn reduces the stress on the programmer and the time spent on debugging.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2.10.2 Features of JUnit\n",
      "JUnit is an open source framework, which is used for writing and running tests.\n",
      "Provides annotations to identify test methods.\n",
      "Provides assertions for testing expected results.\n",
      "Provides test runners for running tests.\n",
      "JUnit tests allow you to write codes faster, which increases quality.\n",
      "JUnit is elegantly simple. It is less complex and takes less time.\n",
      "JUnit tests can be run automatically and they check their own results and provide immediate feedback. There's no need to manually comb through a report of test results.\n",
      "JUnit tests can be organized into test suites containing test cases and even other test suites.\n",
      "JUnit shows test progress in a bar that is green if the test is running smoothly, and it turns red when a test fails.\n",

      "A source code manager (SCM) is a software tool used by teams of programmers to manage source code.\n",
      "SCMs are used to track revisions in software. Each revision is given a timestamp and includes the name of the person who is responsible for the change. Various revisions may be compared, stored, and merged with other revisions.\n",
      "Using revision control software, a programmer or team of programmers may use several approaches for software development. Locally, developers must all use the same computer system, which may be the revision control system. In a distributed model, developers work directly with a local repository, where their individual source code revisions are collected. The developers then update the central repository with their local revisions so that revisions can be shared among developers.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Testing is a crucial part of the software life cycle, and recent trends in software engineering evidence the importance of this activity all along the development process. Testing activities should start at the requirements specification stage, with ahead planning of test strategies and procedures. Testing is a challenging activity that involves several high demanding tasks: at the forefront is the task of deriving an adequate suite of test cases, according to a feasible and cost effective test selection technique. However, test selection is just a starting point, and many other critical tasks face test practitioners with technical and conceptual difficulties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Software testing is an activity to check whether the actual results match the expected results and to ensure that the software system is defect free. It involves execution of a software component or system component to evaluate one or more properties of interest. Software testing also helps to identify errors, gaps or missing requirements in contrary to the actual requirements. It can be either done manually or using automated tools. Some prefer saying Software testing as a white box and black box testing.\n",
